## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 1.1 Data Cleaning
- **Missing Values**: Identified and handled missing values using [method used, e.g., imputation, removal].
- **Outlier Detection**: Detected and addressed outliers using [methods, e.g., IQR method, Z-score].

### 1.2 Data Visualization
- **Univariate Analysis**: Visualized the distribution of individual features using histograms and box plots to understand their characteristics.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Used scatter plots and correlation matrices to examine relationships between features and the target variable.
- **Categorical Analysis**: Analyzed categorical features using bar plots to observe class distributions and potential relationships with the target variable.

### 1.3 Feature Selection
- Performed feature selection using [techniques, e.g., correlation analysis, recursive feature elimination] to identify the most significant predictors for the target variable.

### 1.4 Addressing Class Imbalance
- Used oversampling techniques such as SMOTE to address class imbalance in the dataset. This ensures the model learns effectively from minority classes without overfitting.

## 2. Models

### 2.1 Models Implemented
- **XGBoost**: A powerful gradient boosting algorithm known for its speed and performance.
- **LightGBM**: An efficient gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms.
- **Logistic Regression**: A simple yet effective linear model for binary classification.

## 3. Hyperparameter Tuning

- **Grid Search**: Conducted a grid search with cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters for each model, including:
  - **XGBoost**: Tuned parameters such as learning rate, max depth, and number of estimators.
  - **LightGBM**: Adjusted parameters like num_leaves, learning rate, and boosting type.
  - **Logistic Regression**: Optimized regularization strength (C) and solver method.
  
- The hyperparameter tuning process helped improve the model's performance by finding the best combination of parameters that minimize the loss function.

## 4. Model Evaluation

### 4.1 Evaluation Metrics
- **AUC-ROC Curve**: Plotted the AUC-ROC curve for each model to assess its ability to distinguish between classes. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) provides a single measure of overall model performance.
- **Precision-Recall Curve**: Analyzed precision and recall to evaluate the model's performance, especially under class imbalance. This curve helps understand the trade-off between precision (positive predictive value) and recall (sensitivity).

### 4.2 Results
- **Model Performance**: Summarized the performance of each model based on AUC-ROC and precision-recall scores.
- **Best Model Selection**: Chose the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics and cross-validation results.

## 5. Conclusion

In this project, we successfully performed EDA, trained various classification models, and evaluated their performance using AUC-ROC and precision-recall metrics. The results indicate that [insert best model] is the most effective model for predicting [insert target variable]. Future work could involve [insert potential improvements or future steps].
